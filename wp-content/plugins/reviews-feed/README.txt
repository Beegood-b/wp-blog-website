If a Google business listing has a physical location, you can display your latest reviews for it in an attractive feed. You can also enter the website address of any Yelp business and instantly create a feed of your Yelp reviews as well. Business ratings are an important part of social proof to increase customer confidence in your online business. Website visitors will instantly increase their trust in your business if they can see real customer reviews from real customers.

Showing Google rating and Yelp reviews on your website is one of the best ways to convince site visitors to do business with you and boost your conversions. Customer testimonials are crucial to building positive brand trust for online businesses.

Our plugin makes it easy to set up an automatically updating feed of Google and Yelp reviews. After installing the plugin, create a feed by visiting the Reviews Feed menu item that appears in your dashboard. Configure a source of reviews for your feed, customize the look and feel, then use a shortcode to display your reviews feed anywhere on your site. It takes less than a minute to get started.
